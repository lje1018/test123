I am currently working to develop one of the libraries included in the <a href=\"https://ui.toast.com/\">TOAST UI</a>, and I intend to share all of my experience and know-hows I accumulated along the way. The main purpose of this article is to introduce the readers to pragmatic information like how UI libraries are built, what the purpose and the features of the library are, and what kind of technology stack and webpack configurations were used. If you are interested in learning everything related to building a UI library, get your laptops out, and follow me on this journey.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26706716/63864428-ca97ff80-c9ea-11e9-9fea-8f2e707e98cb.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"motive\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#motive\" aria-label=\"motive permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Motive</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ui.toast.com/tui-grid\">TOAST UI Grid</a>'s revolutionary improvement on the internal structure motivated me to create the v2 for <a href=\"https://ui.toast.com/tui-calendar\">TOAST UI Calendar</a>.

Let's see what other technology stacks we have integrated. The following stacks have been newly introduced to <a href=\"https://ui.toast.com/tui-calendar\">TOAST UI Calendar</a> with respect to v1.</p>\n<p><strong>TypeScript</strong>\nUpon discussing with my coworker, we have elected to use TypeScript. Despite the discomfort it may present to the programmer, we have decide to adopt TypeScript due to the fact that it can lead to easier maintenance later on and the fact that it is less prone to errors.</p>\n<p><strong>Virtual Dom (preact)</strong>\nPreviously, we used <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\">handlebars</a> as the template engine. Because we had to update the entire DOM every time the rendering happens, we decided to adopt the virtual DOM in order to minimize unnecessary rendering.</p>\n<p><strong>ES6 Modules</strong>\nIt is no longer a breakthrough to use ES6 modules. However, the ES6 modules are mandatory in order to perform tree shaking, and <strong>building a UI library that supports tree shaking</strong> is yet another challenge. This particular stack will be discussed more in the next section \"<em>Reasonings Behind the Core Technology Stack</em>.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Server Side Rendering Support</strong>\nWhile it may be an overreach to call it a technology stack, with the introduction of <a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\">preact</a>, it became easier to convert virtual DOM to HTML strings.</p>\n<p><strong>sass and postcss</strong>\nPreviously, we used stylus. However, we have decided to use <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">sass</a> so that the css can be more structured and <a href=\"https://postcss.org/\">postcss</a> so that we could assign the library's unique identifiers to the css class.</p>\n<p>In the next section, we further explore why we have elected to use aforementioned technology stack to build a UI library that supports tree shaking as well as our experience with it.

If you plan on not using TypeScript to build a UI library that is capable of tree shaking, you can achieve the same result by using babel, <code class=\"tui-language-text\">preact</code>, and <code class=\"tui-language-text\">jsx</code>. Now, let break down the reasonings behind the technology stack we have adopted from <strong>JavaScript's point of view.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"tree-shaking-support\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tree-shaking-support\" aria-label=\"tree shaking support permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tree Shaking Support</h3>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://ui.toast.com/tui-calendar\">TOAST UI Calendar</a> supports daily, weekly, monthly, and other periodical views, some users only opt to use a certain types of views. These users should not have to include the entire library just to use a small selection of the features. If the user wants to implement the monthly view feature, the user should not have to include the source code for the weekly view. In order to reduce the size of bundled JavaScript payload on the user-side, we implement our code so that the tree shaking is supported.</p>\n<h4 id=\"module-must-be-free-of-side-effects-in-order-to-allow-tree-shaking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#module-must-be-free-of-side-effects-in-order-to-allow-tree-shaking\" aria-label=\"module must be free of side effects in order to allow tree shaking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong>Module must be free of side effects in order to allow tree shaking.</strong></h4>\n<p>In order to remove unused features among features exported from the module, the bundler must decide whether the feature truly has not been used. For example, if the exported function A references B, the library may think that only A was used. However, function B must be included in the bundle. This is what is known as a side effect, and even if a function was not used declaratively, other functions may have referenced it. The bundler must consider such cases to see whether the exported functions reference each other or not. This is a tricky issue, and can hurt the bundle performance.</p>\n<p>In order to solve such issue, the author of the library must set a flag ensuring that the library is not designed to cause such side effects. Webpack trusts the flag, then, disregards unused modules from the bundle. To do so, set <code class=\"tui-language-text\">&quot;sideEffects&quot;: false</code> in the package.json.</p>\n<h4 id=\"upon-transpilation-the-library-must-be-able-to-be-used-only-with-pure-javascript\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#upon-transpilation-the-library-must-be-able-to-be-used-only-with-pure-javascript\" aria-label=\"upon transpilation the library must be able to be used only with pure javascript permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong>Upon transpilation, the library must be able to be used only with pure JavaScript.</strong></h4>\n<p>It may seem confusing at first, but webpack uses multiple tools like loaders and plugins when bundling JavaScript. JavaScript that requires a loader cannot be executed directly on the JavaScript VM, and the webpack must perform more miniscule operations to make it operational. When the library has been transpiled and bundled using the loader, it can finally be operated with pure JavaScript. Our library must also be able to be used only with pure JavaScript upon transpilation.</p>\n<p>If so, it means that if we want to make an ES6 module that is capable of tree shaking, we cannot use anything that uses a webpack.</p>\n<p>This is because webpack converts every JavaScript module into a webpack module. Even if you bundle using the UMD, the library is converted to use codes like <code class=\"tui-language-text\">__webpack_require__</code>, and all modules are collected to one or more bundle files. Therefore, when the user uses the library, it is no longer an ES6 module. If the module is not of ES6, it cannot be optimized by tree shaking. Furthermore, if all modules are collected into a single bundle file, the chances of side effects increase significantly, so the possibility of tree shaking is close to none.</p>\n<p>Then what about <a href=\"https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/\">Rollup</a>? Rollup is a bundler that lets you build ES6 libraries. Rollup does not use its own moduling method like webpack and maintains the ES6 module structure. When a library is bundled using rollup, all ES6 modules are bundled into one file. However, when the user tries tree shaking using webpack, it is interrupted by side effects.</p>\n<p>Does this mean that we have to abandon all of the conveninent features of webpack loader? TOAST UI Calendar v1 uses <a href=\"https://handlebarsjs.com/\">handlebars</a> for its template engine. While it allowed us write html intuitively, making it convenient for us, it also used webpack loader, so we had to find another solution. We can only use transpilers. The solution I found was using <code class=\"tui-language-text\">preact</code> and <code class=\"tui-language-text\">jsx</code> that supports virtual DOM. <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a> converts <code class=\"tui-language-text\">jsx</code> to <code class=\"tui-language-text\">h</code> function, so when you use it to transpile JavaScript, it produces pure JavaScript.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rendering-optimization-through-virtual-dom\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#rendering-optimization-through-virtual-dom\" aria-label=\"rendering optimization through virtual dom permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Rendering Optimization Through Virtual DOM</h3>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\">preact</a> has a reputation already, it has never been adopted by the <strong>FE Development Lab</strong>, so we actually considered using <a href=\"https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom\">snabbdom</a>. However, as I have mentioned earlier <a href=\"https://medium.com/@toastui/using-preact-to-cut-legacy-codes-in-half-946ced230da1\">preact has proved itself with Grid</a>, so I felt confident using preact with this project.</p>\n<p>The advantage of using the virtual DOM is that it removes unnecessary rendering to optimize the rendering process. The other major benefit is related to tree shaking. With the virtual DOM, we can use <code class=\"tui-language-text\">jsx</code> without a separate template engine. Therefore, we no longer need to use a webpack loader.

It was a frequently posed question on the Github community, and I had to reply to them with sorrow and frustration. We could have implemented server side rendering with v1, but because it was built on an actual DOM, it would have been incredibly difficult to execute it from node environment.</p>\n<p>However, since we have elected to adopt <a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\">preact</a>, the server side rendering, which is basically translating virtual DOM to HTML string, was a piece of cake.</p>\n<h2 id=\"configuring-your-development-environment---step-by-step\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#configuring-your-development-environment---step-by-step\" aria-label=\"configuring your development environment   step by step permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Configuring Your Development Environment - Step By Step</h2>\n<p>Now, let's get down to the business.

If you are familiar with using webpack for your projects, you are probably used to importing the CSS file from your JavaScript code. In this case, if the JavaScript imports CSS after it has been transpiled, the library user must take care of importing the CSS file from the user end. If not, the wrong CSS file path will cause the entire module import to fail. Therefore, simply add importing CSS file to a separate entry point instead of importing at the JavaScript source. If you add the webpack entry points as an array, you can include it in the bundle process by adding another dependency graph without having to import CSS from JavaScript.</p>\n<p>webpack.config.js</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"tui-language-js\"><code class=\"tui-language-js\">module<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>exports <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  entry<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">'./src/sass/index.scss'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'./src/ts/index.ts'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3 id=\"using-scss\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#using-scss\" aria-label=\"using scss permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using SCSS</h3>\n<p>While stylus is an incredible tool, the contributors of TOAST UI Calendar are more used to sass.

This is because the increase in file size inevitably results in higher cost. As for JavaScript UI Library, the more feature a library has, bigger the size becomes. However, users may want to use only a certain selection of features a library provides. Therefore, wouldn't the optimization method for the web also lead to a better UI library? While I chose the tree shaking method, there are cetainly more out there.</p>\n<p>TOAST UI Calendar has been loved ever since we opensourced the well written v1. It received more than 7k stars on <a href=\"https://github.com/nhn/tui.calendar\">Github</a>, and I am genuinely happy that it became a beloved opensource. The process of planning the TOAST UI Calendar v2, deciding on the technology stack, and managing the possibilities were intriguing tasks. Now is the time to take yet another step. I sincerely hope that this article can help other people. The entire source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/dongsik-yoo/esm-ui-library\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a feature you want to see implemented with TOAST UI Calendar v2, please feel free to leave it on the <a href=\"https://github.com/nhn/tui.calendar/issues\">Github issues</a>. Let's keep the momentum going!</p>","frontmatter":{"id":"en_20190829","title":"Building a UI Library Capable of Tree Shaking: From A to Z","description":"The main purpose of this article is to introduce the readers to pragmatic information like how UI libraries are built, what the purpose and the features of the library are, and what kind of technology stack and webpack configurations were used.","date":"2019.08.29","author":"DongSik Yoo","tags":["es6","bundler","React","typescript"],"thumbnail":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26706716/63908104-e76b1c00-ca58-11e9-88db-06c6c5491187.png"}},"allProductsJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"tui-chart","packageName":null,"name":"Chart","type":"application","description":"The Chart makes your data pop, and it is easy to use.
